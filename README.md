# Guessing-Game-Challenge
In this game, the system will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. The user is then supposed to guess the number in the least number of turns. Lesser the number of attempts required, better the performance of the user.
Rules for the game:-
1. If the user enters a number less than 1 or greater than 100, he will receive the prompt "OUT OF BOUNDS!".
2. On the first turn, if the guess is within 10 of the number, the user will see "HOT!", while if it is not then the user will see "COLD!".
3. On successive turns, if the guess is closer than the previous guess, the user will see "HOTTER!" and if it is farther than the previous guess, the user will see "COLDER!".
4. Finally, when the user guesses correctly, he will see the number of attempts he took to guess it correctly.
